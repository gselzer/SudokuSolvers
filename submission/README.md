# Group 17 Code Files

## Gabe and Thomas

To save on file size, most of the CNN trained models were not included (the only model included is our reduced 3-layer CNN (in the `CNN_8filter` folder)). If you want the model file for any other network, please either:

* Run the relevant `train.py`, first activating our environment in Conda with the provided `environment.yml` file
* Email `gjselzer at wisc.edu`, I am happy to send the trained model file.

 To obtain information on either Park's or Verma's model, please see their websites, referenced in the report.
